# kami · 紙

**紙 · かみ** - the paper your deliverables land on.

Good content deserves good paper. One design language across six document types: warm parchment canvas, ink-blue accent, serif-led hierarchy, tight editorial rhythm.

Part of `Kaku · Waza · Kami` - Kaku writes code, Waza drills habits, **Kami delivers documents**.

## Step 1 · Decide the language

**Match the user's language**. If they write in Chinese -> use the Chinese templates (`.html` / `slides.py`). If they write in English -> use the English templates (`-en.html` / `slides-en.py`). The reference docs are shared English specs for both output languages.

When ambiguous (e.g. a one-word command like "resume"), ask a one-liner rather than guess.

| User language | HTML templates | Slides template |
|---|---|---|
| Chinese (primary) | `*.html` | `slides.py` |
| English | `*-en.html` | `slides-en.py` |

Always use `CHEATSHEET.md` and `references/*.md` for design, writing, production, and diagram guidance.

## Step 2 · Pick the document type

| User says | Document | CN template | EN template |
|---|---|---|---|
| "one-pager / 方案 / 执行摘要 / exec summary" | One-Pager | `one-pager.html` | `one-pager-en.html` |
| "white paper / 白皮书 / 长文 / 年度总结 / technical report" | Long Doc | `long-doc.html` | `long-doc-en.html` |
| "formal letter / 信件 / 辞职信 / 推荐信 / memo" | Letter | `letter.html` | `letter-en.html` |
| "portfolio / 作品集 / case studies" | Portfolio | `portfolio.html` | `portfolio-en.html` |
| "resume / resume / CV / 简历" | Resume | `resume.html` | `resume-en.html` |
| "slides / PPT / deck / 演示" | Slides | `slides.py` | `slides-en.py` |

> Long deck (>20 slides): also read Deck Recipe (design.md section 8).

If unsure, ask a one-liner about the scenario rather than guess.

### Diagrams (primitives, not a 7th doc type)

When the user asks for **a diagram inside** a long-doc / portfolio / slide (not a standalone document), route to `assets/diagrams/` rather than a template:

| User says | Diagram | Template |
|---|---|---|
| "架构图 / architecture / 系统图 / components diagram" | Architecture | `assets/diagrams/architecture.html` |
| "流程图 / flowchart / 决策流 / branching logic" | Flowchart | `assets/diagrams/flowchart.html` |
| "象限图 / quadrant / 优先级矩阵 / 2×2 matrix" | Quadrant | `assets/diagrams/quadrant.html` |
| "柱状图 / bar chart / 分类对比 / grouped bars" | Bar Chart | `assets/diagrams/bar-chart.html` |
| "折线图 / line chart / 趋势 / 股价 / time series" | Line Chart | `assets/diagrams/line-chart.html` |
| "环形图 / donut / pie / 占比 / 分布结构" | Donut Chart | `assets/diagrams/donut-chart.html` |
| "状态机 / state machine / 状态图 / lifecycle" | State Machine | `assets/diagrams/state-machine.html` |
| "时间线 / timeline / 里程碑 / milestones / roadmap" | Timeline | `assets/diagrams/timeline.html` |
| "泳道图 / swimlane / 跨角色流程 / cross-team flow" | Swimlane | `assets/diagrams/swimlane.html` |
| "树状图 / tree / hierarchy / 层级 / 组织架构" | Tree | `assets/diagrams/tree.html` |
| "分层图 / layer stack / 分层架构 / OSI / stack" | Layer Stack | `assets/diagrams/layer-stack.html` |
| "维恩图 / venn / 交集 / overlap / 集合关系" | Venn | `assets/diagrams/venn.html` |

Read `references/diagrams.md` before drawing - it has the selection guide, kami token map, and the AI-slop anti-pattern table. Extract the `<svg>` block from the template and drop it into a `<figure>` inside long-doc / portfolio.

Before drawing, always ask: **would a well-written paragraph teach the reader less than this diagram?** If no, don't draw.

## Step 2.1 · Source and material pass

Run this before distilling or filling content when the document depends on facts or materials outside the user's draft. Skip it only for personal drafts where the user already supplied everything needed.

### Source check

Trigger when the document mentions a specific company, product, person, release date, version, funding round, metric, market fact, technical spec, or any current fact likely to change.

- Use primary sources before writing: user-provided material, official site, docs, filings, press release, app store page, or repo release
- Keep a short note of source names and dates for facts that drive the document
- If sources conflict or a fact cannot be checked quickly, ask the user instead of choosing silently
- Avoid current-sounding claims such as "latest", "recent", "new", version numbers, launch dates, or financial figures unless they are checked

### Material check

Trigger when the document is about a company, product, project, venue, or personal brand.

Confirm the materials that make the subject recognizable before layout:

| Need | Required when | Accept |
|---|---|---|
| Logo | Any branded document | User file or official SVG/PNG |
| Product image | Physical product / venue / object | Official image, user image, or marked gap |
| UI screenshot | App / SaaS / website / tool | Current screenshot, official product image, or user capture |
| Brand colors | Branded one-pager / portfolio / deck | Official value, extracted asset value, or keep kami ink-blue |
| Fonts | Only if brand typography matters | Official font, close system fallback, or kami default |

If a required item is missing, use a compact gap table and ask once. Do not replace missing material with generic imagery, approximate logo drawings, or invented values.

## Step 2.5 · Distill raw content (if applicable)

Skip this step if the user already provides structured content (clear sections, bullet points, metrics in place).

When the user hands over **raw material** (meeting notes, brain dump, existing doc in different format, chat transcript, scattered points):

1. **Extract**: pull out every factual claim, number, date, name, source, material reference, and action item
2. **Classify**: map each extract to the target template's sections (see `references/writing.md` for section structure per doc type)
3. **Gap-check**: list what the template needs but the raw content doesn't have - include missing facts, missing proof, and missing materials
4. **Ask once**: share the gap table with the user. Do not guess to fill gaps.

Example gap-check:

| Template needs | Found | Missing |
|---|---|---|
| 4 metric cards | "8 years", "50-person team" | 2 more quantifiable results |
| 3-5 core projects | 2 mentioned | at least 1 more with outcome |
| Materials | logo file provided | product screenshot source |

Then proceed to Step 3 with structured, distilled content.

## Step 3 · Load the right amount of spec

Pick the tier that matches the task. Default to the lowest tier that covers the work.

| Tier | When | Read |
|---|---|---|
| **Content-only** | Updating text, swapping bullets, translating an existing doc. CSS stays untouched. | `CHEATSHEET.md` only |
| **Layout tweak** | Adjusting spacing, moving sections, changing font size within spec. CSS touched. | `CHEATSHEET.md` + template (tokens already inline) |
| **New document** | Building from scratch or from raw content. | Full design spec + writing spec + template |
| **Sources / materials** | Company, product, market, launch, funding, specs, or branded subject. | `writing.md` source rules + user/source material |
| **Deck (>20 slides)** | Long presentation needing Part Divider, Code Cards, section headers. | Full design spec + Deck Recipe (design.md section 8) |
| **Troubleshoot** | Rendering bug, font issue, page overflow. | `production.md` (+ design spec if CSS is the cause) |
| **Diagram** | Embedding SVG in a doc. | `diagrams.md` only (has its own token map) |

You can always escalate mid-task if the work turns out to need more than the initial tier.

The full spec files for reference:
- Design: `references/design.md`
- Writing: `references/writing.md`
- Production: `references/production.md`
- Diagrams: `references/diagrams.md`

## Step 4 · Fill content into the template

- Copy the template into your working directory; don't write HTML from scratch
- **CSS stays untouched**, only edit the body
- Content follows `writing.md`: data over adjectives, distinctive phrasing over industry clichés

### Fill PDF metadata (WeasyPrint reads these into the PDF)

Every template has meta placeholders in `<head>`. Fill all four before building:

| Placeholder (CN) | Placeholder (EN) | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `{{作者}}` | `{{AUTHOR}}` | Resume/letter/portfolio: use the person's name from the doc. All others: `"Kami"` |
| `{{摘要}}` | `{{DESCRIPTION}}` | Extract one sentence (≤150 chars) from the first 2 paragraphs |
| `{{关键词}}` | `{{KEYWORDS}}` | 3-5 keywords from the title + section headings, comma-separated |
| `{{文档标题}}` / `{{信件主题}}` etc. | `{{DOC_TITLE}}` / `{{LETTER_SUBJECT}}` etc. | Infer from the H1 or `.header .title` text |

`<meta name="generator" content="Kami">` is already fixed in the template; do not change it.

## Step 5 · Build & verify

```bash
python3 scripts/build.py --verify           # build all templates + page count + font check + slides
python3 scripts/build.py --verify resume-en # single target full verification
python3 scripts/build.py --verify slides    # single slide deck verification
python3 scripts/build.py --check-placeholders path/to/filled.html
python3 scripts/build.py --check            # CSS rule violations only (fast, no build)
```

Source templates intentionally keep `{{...}}` fields. Run placeholder checks on completed documents, not on the template library.

Visual anomalies (tag double rectangle, font fallback, page break issues) -> `production.md` Part 4.

## Fonts

**Chinese**
- Main serif: TsangerJinKai02-W04.ttf (400 weight) + TsangerJinKai02-W05.ttf (500 weight, real bold)
- Templates use dual @font-face declarations: W04 for body text, W05 for headings
- Both files are commercial fonts. Keep them available in the repository for local preview and CDN fallback, but do not bundle them inside Claude Desktop skill ZIPs
- Fallback chain baked into templates: Source Han Serif SC -> Noto Serif CJK SC -> Songti SC -> Georgia

**English**
- Main serif: Newsreader (Google Fonts, open source) - used for both headlines and body
- Sans: Inter (open source) - used for UI elements only (labels, eyebrows, meta)
- Fallback: Charter (macOS) / Georgia (cross-platform), Helvetica Neue / system-ui

Font files next to HTML and `@font-face` relative paths is the most stable setup. For Claude Desktop releases, run `scripts/package-skill.sh`; it excludes `assets/fonts/TsangerJinKai02-W04.ttf` and `assets/fonts/TsangerJinKai02-W05.ttf` while keeping the smaller open-source font files.

**Font auto-recovery (Claude Desktop)**

When building a Chinese document, check whether the font files are present before running the build. If they are missing, download them directly into `assets/fonts/` so WeasyPrint picks them up via the existing relative `@font-face` path, no HTML changes needed:

```bash
# Check
test -f assets/fonts/TsangerJinKai02-W04.ttf || {
  curl -fsSL "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tw93/Kami@main/assets/fonts/TsangerJinKai02-W04.ttf" \
    -o assets/fonts/TsangerJinKai02-W04.ttf
  curl -fsSL "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tw93/Kami@main/assets/fonts/TsangerJinKai02-W05.ttf" \
    -o assets/fonts/TsangerJinKai02-W05.ttf
}
```

Run this check once before `python3 scripts/build.py`. If the network is unavailable, WeasyPrint falls back to Source Han Serif SC; warn the user but still deliver the PDF.

## Feedback protocol

When the user gives **vague visual feedback** ("looks off", "不对劲", "spacing weird", "too cramped", "not elegant"):

Do not guess. Ask back using kami vocabulary, with current values included.

| User says | Ask about |
|---|---|
| "太挤了" / "too cramped" | Which element? Line-height (current: X)? Padding (current: Y)? Page margin? |
| "太松了" / "too loose" | Same direction, reversed |
| "颜色不对" / "color feels wrong" | Which element? Brand blue overused? A gray reading too cool? |
| "不够好看" / "not polished" | Font rendering? Alignment? Whitespace distribution? Hierarchy unclear? |
| "看着不专业" / "unprofessional" | Content wording? Or layout (alignment, consistency)? |

Template response: "X is currently set to Y. Would you like (a) [specific alternative within spec] or (b) [another option]?"

Never say "I'll adjust the spacing" without naming the exact property and its new value.

## When not to use this skill

- User explicitly wants Material / Fluent / Tailwind default - different design language
- Need dark / cyberpunk / futurist aesthetic (this is deliberately anti-future)
- Need saturated multi-color (this has one accent)
- Need cartoon / animation / illustration style (this is editorial)
- Web dynamic app UI (this is for print / static documents)

Next: **apply Step 3's tier table to decide what to read**, then copy the matching template and start filling.
